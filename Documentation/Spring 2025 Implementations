Here is what we got done:

1.  /calendar:

2.  /importcalendar:

3.  /calreminder: - Google OAuth flow wired up so users can link their calendar

        - Events pulled into bot memory via retrieveEvents()

        - Parsing system extracts summary, start date/time, location, etc.

        - Filter menu lets you pick by course ID, day, date, location (virtual/in-person)

        - UI shows 3 events per page with Next/Prev buttons

        - Offset selector (At event, 10m / 30m / 1h / 1 d before)

        - “Repeat” toggle for per-event reminders (bug documented in code)

        - Builds reminder date, checks against past times

        - Inserts reminder into MongoDB (calreminders collection)

        - Sends ephemeral DM confirmation with the scheduled time

4.  /cancelreminder:

        - “Cancel Reminder” button available after setting a reminder

        - Deletes the reminder document from MongoDB

        - Sends an ephemeral DM follow-up: “Your reminder has been canceled.”

        - Basic try/catch around the delete, logs errors to console

5.  /viewreminders:

        - Fetches all upcoming reminders for the invoking user from MongoDB

        - Displays them in pages of 3 (same paginated UI as /calreminder)

        - Shows event summary, reminder time, and repeat status

        - All output sent as an ephemeral DM for privacy
