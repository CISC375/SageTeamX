Hi Again!

This is more for the manager's knowledge but this contains what was left and what our project baord meant to us:

Ready - We either didn't get to it or We put it back after minor developements
In Progress - We have made enough progress but either ran into issues, bugs, or time restraint
In Review - We have the majority of it done besides minor items or a lack of testing the feature/task out
Done - We think it is olid and we worked through it

The majority of the left over tasks that we had we dealing with testing and a second wave of user experience testing with real users
But this may be subject to change.

I hope this helps!
