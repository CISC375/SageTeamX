Hi NewComer!

My name is Victoria Nikolaeva, I am the Team X Engineering Manager for the Fall 2024! 
This project is all abouot helping students get the help they need through the Sage Bot in UDCISC Discord.
Our project focuses on a calendar command that allows pulls the events from a google calendar and will display
it to the user who calls the command.

I wanted to give you some helpful advise when working on this project!

To ensure that everything works when you pull there are 2 items you will have to set up:
1) A Personal Bot
2) Your own Database

During the developement of our run with this project, we created a fake google calendar with office hours,
I want to be nice so here is the calendar link that should allow you to just add it to your manger's calendar (make sure to use school email for this)
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19kZDI4YTk5NzdkYTUyNjg5NjEyNjI3ZDc4NjY1NGU5OTE0ZDM1MzI0ZjdmY2ZjOTI4YTdhYWIyOTRhNGE3Y2UzQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20

^ If you don't want to use this, make sure to update your calendar's ID in the files to ensure a connection between the two

Also, please make sure you are pushing into the correct repository!!! Too many times, my developers try to push our changes into the Main Sage Repo.
Plus, you should estalish some early on documentation of how your branches, comments, and codebase would look like and try to establish a well
maintained project board

Overall, I wish you luck!

From Team X of 2024!
