Our focuses for this semester:

1. Finish up/test In Review tasks from Fall 2024
2. Work on the 'In-Progress' tasks 
	-Identify whether it was a time constraint issue or an error/bug
3. Work on 'Ready' tasks
4. Identify new tasks
	- User testing
		- First wave of testing was asking other teams what they liked/didn't like
		- Sprint Review is a good time for this!


# Filter Feature: Go by time/date/course name
	# - Looking for student/professor
	# - Design-focused/UI

# Getting started : Look over last semester's sprint reviews/reports to gain familiarity with the system.
