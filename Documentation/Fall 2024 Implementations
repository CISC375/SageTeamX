Here is what we got done:

- We autherized the connection between the Google API calendar system and the Discord Bot connection
- We manage to get events pulled from said calendar into the bot's memeory
- We have a parsing system that helps organize the events and is the basics of the filter system
- We have a basic filter system that looks for courseID, Day of the Week, Date, Location Type (Virtual/In-Person), etc. (check out the code for more)
- We wanted a better UI for it but ran out of time for it
- We have the basics of the notification system with the logic and the majority of the code, but there is a current bug we could not figure out
   (It should be documented in the code)
- We can display the pulled, parsed information into a easy UI friendly design of 3 events per a page, that while stay within 5 minutes before bot deactivates
- There is a database that is currently connected and gets the inofrmation, though it has not been fully tested out yet.
- There is minor error-handling but not alot of intensive testing to try to push the barrier
- We got multi-platorm command to work but it requires a first time authetication which means the user has to use it on a desktop first before using their mobile device
    ( This is something we wished we had more time to develope on to see other ways to get it done)
- We have a privacy barrier by letting the bot make it into a private DM instead of publi viewing
-This is all done under the idea that there will be one unified calendar for the entire CISC Department

That's pretty much should be it! Hope you got some ideas from this or at least know where you stand with everything!
Thank you!
